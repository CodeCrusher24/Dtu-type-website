              <p>Virangana Lakshmi Bai was the queen of the princely state of Jhansi, which is located on the northern side of India. She is known for her significant role in the first war of India's independence of 1857, against the rule of the British East India Company. Lakshmibai was born as Manikarnika Moropant Tambe on 19 November 1828 in Varanasi, northern India. She became the Queen of Jhansi and was then known as Lakshmi Bai upon her marriage. At the tender age of 18 years, she bravely bore the tragedy of widowhood. In the 1857 war, Maharani strapped her son to her back to ensure her kingdom's safety and fought against the troops with a sword in one hand, thus was her heroism and valour. This unimaginable bravery combined with her leadership broke several shackles for women and continues to inspire millions of us. Maharani Lakshmi Bai died like a heroine at the young age of 29 and was amongst the most contributing characters.</p>
              
              <p>While exposure to literacy and the art of warfare was not accessible for most women, her parents ensured she became well-versed in the art of statesmanship and warfare very early in life. She was the embodiment of women's empowerment. Her tale depicts the latent feminine potential which is yet to come out. For women today, she is the idol of empowerment and equality. She stands out as the epitome of courage earning her the title of "Virangana", immortalized by the famous poetess Subhadra Kumari Chauhan's ballad in her praiseâ€”"Khoob Ladi Mardani Woh acto Jhansi Wali Rani Thi".</p>
