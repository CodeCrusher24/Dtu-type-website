## 🛠️ Development Notes

This project includes a few **Node.js scripts** used only for development and code maintenance:

| Script                | Purpose                                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `fix-sidebar.js`     | Fixes sidebar class names across HTML pages            |
| `update-page-titles.js` | Updates `<title>` sections site-wide               |
| `header-loader.js`   | Resolves image paths dynamically in JS                 |
